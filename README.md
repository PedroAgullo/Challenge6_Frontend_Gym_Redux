## **Tools**

We have used these tools to help us in the project:

**Visual Studio Share**:

With this extension we were able to work simultaneously on the code and to do it together which helped us in the learning and development of the project.

**Trello:**

We used Trello to organise ourselves, to draw up the list of requirements and to see in detail how we were progressing and what we were missing.

**Coolors co:**

Coolors is the essential tool for creating and collecting color palettes. It allows you to generate perfect matching colors in seconds.

**Wireframe cc:**

Wireframe is a minimalist web app for instantly creating wireframes.This can help users to create page schematics for websites or mobile apps. This web app does not require any complex configurations and all you have to do is to sketch out your ideas on a virtual drawing board.
